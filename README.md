Python code to access MySQL from within Excel, using DataNitro

There are a few examples accessing a few databases already, but this one shows you how to connect to MySQL,
allowing for ways to CRUD from an Excel spreadsheet. So for example if you had a standard LAMP stack using PHP, you 
can now make use of all Excel features along with Python. Or you can improve updating your database if all your 
source data comes from local spreadsheets.
